Welcome to Checker's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the complete guide, If you're looking to understand the checker tool then you've come to the right place.

As we know one of the most important subjects in a production is keep the asset “healthy” through along the pipeline
this can be the difference between a relax walk in the park or a nightmare of retakes and overtime in order to avoid
the technical difficulties and let the artist focus in what they do best (art) We establish a series of checkpoints
to be followed.
